## Problem statements of different Assignment::

###                         Know Your Data:

We will work with the dataset weights-heights.csv containing height, weight & gender. This
data set is available at Kaggle.

a. Visualize the data by creating scatter plots of the data. Write your observations
about the data.
b. Do One Hot Encoding of the nominal predictor. How many predictors do you have
now?
c. Apply Standardization to real value predictors.
d. Create scatter plots of the transformed data. Write your observations about the
data.
e. Create heat map to visualize the correlation between all variable pairs.
f. There are no missing values in this data. Randomly delete some of the data and
apply various methods to handle missing values.
g. Identify skewness in the data and apply transformation if required.
h. Does the data have outliers? Identify and remove outliers.
i. Transform height into Short, Medium and Tall categories using equal frequency
and equal width bins. Write your observations.


###                         Classification-KNN

We will work with the iris dataset containing 3 different species of iris
flower. This data set is available at Kaggle.

1. Classify the data using 1-NN method. Build three classifiers using oneagainst-all approach (M1).
2. Show accuracy of your model.
3. Build 1-NN model without using the classifier provided by the Python
library. Compute Euclidean distance to find the nearest neighbor (M2).
Compare the accuracy of M1 and M2.
4. Build KNN model for classification using one against all technique for
multi classification problem.
5. Try different values of hyper-parameters to observe and optimize
results.
6. Write your observations after each exercise.


###                        Regression-Analysis

In this assignment we will work with “Medical Cost Personal Dataset”, where we will predict
yearly medical bill from given attributtes. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to
determine the yearly insurance premium for a person.
You can access dataset from Kaggle.

Steps to be performed:
1. EDA (Expolatory Data Analysis)
2. Visualization
3. Prepare Dataset for training (treating outliers, null values, standardization, label
encoding, etc)
4. Create and train Linear Regression model
5. Make Prediction.
6. Plot training and testing error


###                       Non-linear Classification

In this assignment we will work with Social Network Ads dataset, where we will predict if a
customer will make a purchase or not. Dataset is available on the Kaggle site.

Steps to be performed:
1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
2. Create a linear SVM model for classification.
3. Create SVM model with polynomial and Gaussian radial basis kernel functions.
4. Visualize the hyperplane of all your models.
